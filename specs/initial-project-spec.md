**Role:** Act as an expert AI consultant and senior technical mentor.

**Project:** I am starting a new project to build an AI chatbot. I need your help to create a comprehensive project plan and learning roadmap.

**Chatbot Vision:**
The chatbot's purpose is to guide a user through a self-discovery path, helping them identify their spiritual gifts and personal style. A core focus will be helping the user find the right balance between what they are good at (skills) and what they enjoy doing (passions).

**My Goals:**
1.  **Primary Goal: Learning.** To teach myself the fundamental skills necessary to build a modern AI chatbot. I want to understand the core components and architecture. This is more important than the final product.
2.  **Secondary Goal: Prototype.** To have a working chatbot prototype that I can share with friends and family for feedback.

**My Background:**
- **Experience:** I have 30+ years of experience as a programmer and Software Engineer.
- **Strengths:** I am very comfortable with general-purpose programming, writing code to query APIs (like REST APIs), and processing JSON responses.
- **LLM Familiarity:** I frequently use chat interfaces like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. I have used code-generation tools like the Claude Code CLI.
- **Knowledge Gaps:** I have minimal to no direct experience with applied machine learning, such as fine-tuning models, working directly with neural networks, or implementing concepts like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

**Clarification on "Building From Scratch":**
When I say I want to learn to build this, I mean I want to write the code that orchestrates the components (e.g., conversation management, API calls to a model provider, business logic). I do **not** mean I want to train a foundational large language model from zero.

**My Request - The Project Plan:**
I need your help developing a detailed plan. Please structure your response to cover the following key areas. For each area, please provide recommendations and explain the trade-offs.

1. **Conceptual Architecture & Technology Stack:**
    - What is a typical high-level architecture for a chatbot like this? What are the essential components?
    - Should I use a foundational model via an API (e.g., from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) or a self-hosted open-source model? What are the pros and cons for my learning goal?
    - What programming language and key libraries would you recommend? (e.g., Python with libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or just using `requests` and building my own logic).
    - What is the role of a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma) in a project like this, and do I need one to start?

2. **Phased Development Roadmap:**
    - Please outline a step-by-step roadmap with clear milestones. Start with the absolute simplest version (e.g., a "hello world" bot that just calls an API) and progressively add features towards my final vision.
    - Example phases might be:
        - Phase 1: Basic API call and response.
        - Phase 2: Managing conversation history (state).
        - Phase 3: Implementing the core "self-discovery" logic.
        - Phase 4: Creating a simple user interface.

3. **Core Chatbot Logic - The "Self-Discovery" Engine:**
    - How should I approach the core logic of guiding the user? Should I use a structured decision tree, a prompt-chaining strategy, or a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach where the bot pulls from curated documents about spiritual gifts or personal styles?
    - What would be a good way to model the user's journey and track their progress?

4. **Learning Path:**
    - Tied to the roadmap, what are the key concepts I need to learn at each phase?
    - Can you suggest specific, high-quality resources (e.g., tutorials, articles, official documentation) that are well-suited for an experienced software engineer who is new to the AI/ML space?

5. **Your First Task for Me:**
    - To get me started *today*, what is the single most important first technical step I should take? (e.g., "Get an API key from X," "Set up a Python virtual environment with these specific libraries," "Read this one specific foundational article.")

Let's approach this as an iterative conversation. This initial prompt is for you to lay out the foundational plan. I will then ask follow-up questions to refine it.
