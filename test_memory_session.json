Your deep listening, coupled with your desire to help others, suggests a profound capacity for empathy and understanding.  You possess the gift of creating safe spaces where people feel heard and valued.  This, in turn, suggests gifts in communication, perhaps even counseling or mediation.  The joy you find in these interactions points to a natural talent for connection and support.  What resonates most with you from these observations?  And considering these gifts, what kind of helping role might you envision for yourself – perhaps something involving coaching, mentoring, or community work?\n",
